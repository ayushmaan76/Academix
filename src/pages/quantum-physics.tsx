          Quantum physics, or quantum mechanics, is the fundamental theory that describes the behavior of particles on the smallest scales â€” atoms, photons, and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics reveals a universe that is inherently probabilistic and non-deterministic.
        </p>

        <p>
          The revolutionary ideas of physicists like <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, <strong>Niels Bohr</strong>, and <strong>Werner Heisenberg</strong> in the early 20th century changed our understanding of nature forever.

          Some <span className="font-semibold">key principles</span> you should know:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Superposition:</strong> A particle can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is observed. Example: SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat being both alive and dead.</li>
          <li><strong>Entanglement:</strong> Two particles can become connected such that the state of one instantly influences the other, even across vast distances.</li>
          <li><strong>Uncertainty Principle:</strong> Proposed by Heisenberg, it states you cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle exactly.</li>
          <li><strong>Wave-Particle Duality:</strong> Light and matter exhibit properties of both particles and waves, depending on how they are observed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Quantum mechanics is not just theory â€” it powers technologies like <strong>lasers</strong>, <strong>MRI machines</strong>, <strong>quantum computing</strong>, and even the inner workings of your smartphone's semiconductors.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8">Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Without quantum theory, modern technology would look completely different. Some examples include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Quantum Cryptography: Provides secure communication methods based on the laws of physics rather than human-made algorithms.</li>
          <li>Quantum Computing: Leverages quantum bits (qubits) to perform computations at speeds unimaginable for classical computers.</li>
          <li>Medical Imaging: MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) uses principles of quantum mechanics to visualize internal organs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8">Mind-Bending Thought Experiments</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum physics challenges our intuition. Famous examples include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s Cat:</strong> A cat in a box can be simultaneously dead and alive until observed.</li>
          <li><strong>Double-Slit Experiment:</strong> Particles act like waves when not observed, but like particles when measured â€” suggesting observation affects reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Quantum physics not only teaches us about nature, but also challenges deep philosophical questions about the nature of reality itself.
